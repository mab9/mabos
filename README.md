mabos is a tool to track subscription expenses and expirations. To that it servers as a test project to try some architectural concepts.

## Local development

Requirements:
- Java 21
- docker with compose
- Node for Angular 17

Start project - Linux and macOS:
```
0. git clone https://github.com/mab9/mabos.git
1. cd mabos
2. docker compose -f compose-local.yml up -d
3. cd spa && npm installs
3. cd spa && npm run start
4. cd backent && ../mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

### SPA Notes - Frontend

- see package.json scripts.
- icons 4 angular material: https://fonts.google.com/icons


### Some docker commands

build images

    cd backent
    docker build -t mabru/mabos-backent .
    cd spa
    docker build -t mabru/mabos-spa .

### Some keycloak commands

Export keycloak realm - can be imported on keycloak startup

      docker exec -i mabos-keycloak-1 /bin/sh -c '/opt/keycloak/bin/kc.sh export --realm mabos-realm --file /tmp/mabos-realm.json --users realm_file'
      docker cp mabos-keycloak-1:/tmp/mabos-realm.json ./deployment/realm-mabos.json


## Server deployment

Keycloak is using the Postgres DB in an own schema named keycloak.
Make sure, that the initial DB scripts are executed to be able to start keycloak.
The init scripts are located in the folder db at project root.


1. start postgres, keycloak, backent and frontend with docker compose
2. provide env file with parametrized secrets: .secrets.server.env
3. ensure, that DB was setup correctly.

   docker compose --env-file ./deployment/.secrets.local.env -f compose-server.yml up -d # if you want to test server compose on local env
   docker compose --env-file ./deployment/.secrets.server.env -f compose-server.yml up -d
   docker compose --env-file ./deployment/.secrets.server.env -f compose.yml up -d

Side notes

    To connect from a container to another container inside the same network:
    - use the service name -> spa, backent, postgres or keycloak
    - use the containers port, not the exposed port on the host system (8080 for keycloak)
